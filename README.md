# Binary-search-tree-AVL
This repo contains classes for the general binary search tree nodes, traversals and exceptions. 
It has an AVL tree implemented. AVL tree is a self-balancing BST.

My implementation of an AVl binary search tree
An avl is a tree that automatically keeps balance
so for each node the difference of heights of left and right subtrees cannot differ more done 1

While creating this I supported myself with this guy's channel
